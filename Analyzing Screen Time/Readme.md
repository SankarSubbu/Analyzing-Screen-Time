# Analyzing Screen time with Python

Screen time analysis refers to analyzing the amount of time a user spends interacting with their device (such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer) and various applications on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. So, if you want to learn how to analyze the screen time of a user, this article is for you. In this article, Iâ€™ll take you through the task of analyzing the screen time of a user using Python.

For the task of analyzing the screen time of a user, we need data about the app usage activity of a user on a particular device. I found an ideal dataset for this task, which contains features like:

* Date: The date on which the data was recorded.
* App: The name of the application being used (e.g., Instagram, WhatsApp).
* Usage (minutes): The total number of minutes spent on the app daily.
* Notifications: The number of notifications received from the app each day.
* Times Opened: The number of times the app was opened on the recorded day.
